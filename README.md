# health-promotion-ab-testing

This project explores the impact of two digital wellness reminders (A and B) on user behavior using experimentation and statistical modeling. The goal is to improve habit adherence and overall wellness outcomes in a digital health context.

I will be using A/B testing and logistic regression modeling to:
- Determine whether Reminder B leads to improved sleep, stress, and step count
- Identify key predictors of daily habit completion
- Provide actionable insights to improve app feature effectiveness
